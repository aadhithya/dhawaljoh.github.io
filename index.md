Starting Fall, 2016, I will be joining <a href="https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">LINQS</a> at UCSC and will be advised by <a href="https://getoor.soe.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">Prof. Lise Getoor</a>. <br><br>
I graduated from <em><a class="tosu" href="http://www.manipal.edu" target="_blank">Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal</a></em> with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering in July, 2015. While there, I was actively involved with IEEE Student Branch Manipal and served as its Techincal Secretary for the year 2013-14.

My interests lie in the intersection of Statistical Relational Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning.
